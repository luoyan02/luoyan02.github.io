Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Hi! I’m Luoyan, a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.duffield.cornell.edu/ece/) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), advised by [Prof. Cara Nunez](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LB7sjGwAAAAJ) in the [HAPPI Lab](https://cornellhappilab.com/) (Human Augmentation in Physical and Perceptual Interactions). My research focuses on tactile sensing for robotic manipulation and human–robot interaction. In particular, I study how surface curvature and contact geometry affect flexible tactile sensors, and how data-driven calibration pipelines can enable robust force and curvature estimation across diverse materials, sensor designs, and interaction scenarios.

Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering (B.E.) from the [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), School of Information Science and Technology, majoring in Automation.

**Personal**: Outside of research, I enjoy traveling, road trips, hiking, and running
